zip to other and with jarfile(zip) got direct execution of java programm
comand to run jar file: C:\jar>java -jar myproject.jar (jar file name that give during the crating with path)
->manifiest file inside the meta folder conatain the main class which is executing and select during the creating jar file

->Each remote name (e.g., origin, org, origina, origins) can point to a different Git repository URL.
->git remote remove org(delete a remote)Deleting a remote does not delete code on your local machine. It only removes the link to the remote repository.
->git remote set-url origin https://github.com/new-user/new-repository.git(If the current remote URL is no longer valid (e.g., the repository has moved), you can update the URL of the existing remote using the git remote set-url command.
For example, to update the URL for origin (the default remote name):)
git branch -r
->he git push origin collection --force command is used when you want to forcefully push your local changes to the remote repository, potentially overwriting the remote branch's history. It is typically used in the following scenarios:
//git push origin collection --force
->Ctrl + Shift + C
